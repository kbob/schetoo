Little things
DONE	Change all make_foo() to make_foo_fill().
DONE	Verify all ASSERTs are needed.
DONE	Remove all #include <assert.h>.
DONE	Enable selftest.
DONE	Align function declarations in *.h.
DONE	Rename all "hdr" to "hobj".
DONE	Rename "normal pointer" to "heap object".
DONE	Rename check_obj() to CHECK_OBJ().
DONE	Refactor mem.h.
DONE	Make is_TYPE() inline by exporting the mem_ops_t structures.
DONE	Move is_null() and is_undefined() to their own files.
	Find better names for EMPTY_LIST and UNDEFINED.
	Rationalize wchar_t and char_t.

Heap
	Implement records.
	Implement procedures.
	Hook GC into setjmp (after eval).
	Reintroduce debug GC on every allocation.
	Automatically grow heap when out of memory.
	Speed up symbol lookup.
	Speed up environments -- two kinds.

Data
	Implement binding as record.
	Implement continuation as record.
	Implement procedure.
	Implement condition as record.
	Implement compound condition as record (not derived from condition).

Eval
	Design eval main loop.
	  -- setjmp and exceptions
	  -- multiple values
	  -- arg lists
	  -- nice calling convention for primitive procs
	  -- exception safe
