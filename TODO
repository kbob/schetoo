Little things
DONE	Change all make_foo() to make_foo_fill().
	Remove all #include <assert.h>
	Verify all ASSERTs are needed.
	Rename "normal pointer" to "heap object".
	Refactor mem.h.

Heap
	Implement records.
	Hook GC into setjmp.
	Speed up symbol lookup.
	Speed up environments -- two kinds.

Eval
	Design eval main loop.
	  -- setjmp and exceptions
	  -- multiple values?
	  -- arg lists
	  -- nice calling convention for primitive procs
