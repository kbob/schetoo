Little things
DONE	Change all make_foo() to make_foo_fill().
DONE	Verify all ASSERTs are needed.
DONE	Remove all #include <assert.h>.
	Enable selftest.
	Align function declarations in *.h.
	Rename all "hdr" to "hobj".
	Rename "normal pointer" to "heap object".
	Rename check_obj() to CHECK_OBJ().
	Refactor mem.h.
	Rationalize wchar_t and char_t.

Heap
	Implement records.
	Hook GC into setjmp (after eval).
	Reintroduce debug GC on every allocation.
	Automatically grow heap when out of memory.
	Speed up symbol lookup.
	Speed up environments -- two kinds.

Eval
	Design eval main loop.
	  -- setjmp and exceptions
	  -- multiple values
	  -- arg lists
	  -- nice calling convention for primitive procs
