Little things
DONE	Change all make_foo() to make_foo_fill().
DONE	Verify all ASSERTs are needed.
DONE	Remove all #include <assert.h>.
DONE	Enable selftest.
DONE	Align function declarations in *.h.
DONE	Rename all "hdr" to "hobj".

DONE	Refactor mem.h.
DONE	Make is_TYPE() inline by exporting the mem_ops_t structures.
DONE	Move is_null() and is_undefined() to their own files.
DONE	Find better names for EMPTY_LIST and UNDEFINED.

	Reintroduce debug GC on every allocation.
	Automatically grow heap when out of memory.
	Implement transactional checks.
	Speed up environments.
