Note 1: Give up on saving a word on pairs.  Just give them a normal
type record.  Revisit later if you really want to.

Note 2: Unify the rdt and the mem_ops_t.  Give them the same layout,
maybe with some fields unused.  Then the heap copying code doesn't
have to special case record instances.  Add an "I am not in the heap"
flag somewhere, so the copier can ignore out-of-heap rdts.
