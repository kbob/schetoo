Note 1: Give up on saving a word on pairs.  Just give them a normal
type record.  Revisit later if you really want to.

Note 2: Unify the rdt and the mem_ops_t.  Give them the same layout,
maybe with some fields unused.  Then the heap copying code doesn't
have to special case record instances.  Add an "I am not in the heap"
flag somewhere, so the copier can ignore out-of-heap rdts.

If we're going to use the C reader with Scheme I/O, we need a general
way for C to call Scheme.  I think.

Time to refactor mem.h.  First cut: three kinds of data -- whole heap
operations, things that are needed for obj definitions, and things
that are needed throughout the interpreter.

Whole heap stuff (heap.h?)
	set_heap_size_bytes()
	init_heap()
	
Obj definition stuff (mem.h?):
	heap_object_t
	OBJ_ALIGN
	is_forward()
	is_immediate()
	is_special()
	obj_heap_ptr()
	obj_fwd_ptr()
	heap_object_set_fwd_ptr()
	mem ops
	mem_ops_t definition
	heap_object
	obj_heap_object()
	heap_obect_mem_ops()
	obj_mem_ops()
	is_primitive_obj()
	is_record_instance()
	CHECK_OBJ, check_obj
	mem_alloc_obj

Global stuff (obj.h? object.h?):
	obj_t
	word_t
	masks, tags, shifts, and bits
	obj_bits()
	macros to create chars, bools, and reader constants
	FALSE_OBJ (obj_boolean.h?)
	TRUE_OBJ (obj_boolean.h?)
	EMPTY_LIST (obj_null.h?)
	UNDEFINED (obj_undefined.h?)
	END_OF_FILE (obj_???)
	MEM_OPS_PRIMITIVE
	READER_CONSTANT - rename to READER_ACTION?
	is_heap()
	is_null() (obj_null.h?)
	is_undefined (obj_undefined.h)
	mem_ops_t declaration
	obj_type_name()

Work interferes.

Trying to decide what the next big step should be.  I wanted to
implement continuations as records, which means I need records next.
Or I could just do continuations ad-hoc and move on to eval.

I've been thinking about the problem of calling Scheme from C.  I
can't just call eval() from arbitrary places because (a) eval() uses a
static jmp_buf to recover from exceptions, and (b) I'm trying to have
a hard bound on C stack size.

So I reviewed the C coroutine literature.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine#Implementations_for_C
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html

Nothing there appears to be directly applicable.  So for now, the rule
is, C does not call Scheme (except once at the top level).

So let's talk about eval.  One question to answer is, what happens
when a procedure is applied to some arguments?  The old Scheme
interpreter had some complex mumbo-jumbo where it built the arg list
in place as each arg was evaluated, and then the procedure was called.

I'm envisioning four registers.

    CONT is the continuation register.  It points to the current
    eval's continuation.  Think of it as a return PC.

    TBE is to-be-evaluated.  It points to a LIFO list of expressions
    to evaluate.

    VALUES points to a LIFO list of values of past evaluations.

    ENV is the current environment.

Eval's basic operation is to pop one item off TBE, evaluate it,
push the result onto VALUES, and then jump to CONT.

For self-evaluating expressions, that's pretty easy.

    def eval(expr):
        expr = TBE.pop()
        if expr.is_self_evaluating():
            VALUES = cons(expr, VALUES)
        elif ...
            ...
        goto CONT

For symbols, it's just a lookup in the current environment.

        ...
        elif expr.is_symbol():
            VALUES = cons(ENV.lookup(expr), VALUES)
        ...

For applications (aka procedure calls), we need to push a continuation
to apply the operator to its args and then push more continuations to
evaluate each of the arguments.  (Ignore special forms for now.)

        ...
        elif expr.is_application():
            CONT = make_continuation(code=apply,
                                     arg=expr,
                                     arg2=VALUES,
                                     env=ENV,
                                     cont=CONT)
            for arg in expr.arguments():
                CONT = make_continuation(code=eval,
                                         arg=arg,
                                         env=ENV,
                                         cont=CONT)
        ...

Then apply looks something like this.

    def apply(expr, eoargs):
        # Reverse and null-terminate the argument list
        args = nil
        while VALUES != eoargs:
            args = cons(car(VALUES), args)
            VALUES = cdr(VALUES)
        CONT = make_continuation(code=expr.operator(),
                                 env=push_env(expr.arglist, args, ENV),
                                 cont=CONT)

Something like that.

Meanwhile, there is a large number of primitives.  It would be grand
if we had a simple ABI for simple primitives.  Something like this.

    obj_t my_primitive(obj_t arg1, obj_t arg2)
    {
         return <return value>;
    }

Maybe wrap a macro around that to bind a symbol to the procedure.

    DEFINE_SIMPLE_PROC("my-primitive", 2)(obj_t arg1, obj_t arg2)
    {
        return <return value>;
    }

----------------------------------

Alternative eval VM.

An "instruction" has a varying number of fields (operands).  Two
fields are always included: proc is the C procedure that implements
the instruction, and cont is the address of the next instruction
(continuation).

An instruction manipulates the three global registers, VALUES, ENV,
and CONT.  VALUES is a list of values of previously evaluated
expressions.  ENV is the current environment.  CONT points to the
next instruction.

A self-eval instruction evaluates a self-evaluating expression.  It
has three fields. proc = eval_const, expr = the self-evaluated
expresion, and cont = whatever.  The self_eval procedure looks like
this.

    void eval_const(obj_t inst)
    {
        VALUES.push(inst.arg);
	CONT = CONT.cont
    }

Each instruction the result of evaluating its expression.

A eval_symbol instruction evaluates a symbol.  It uses the global
register ENV.  The three fields are proc = eval_sym, arg = the symbol,
and cont.

    void eval_sym(obj_t inst)
    {
        VALUES.push(lookup(inst.arg, ENV);)
    }

An application instruction applies a procedure to a symbol.  It has
three fields: proc = eval_app, arg = VALUES, and cont = whatever.
eval_app looks like this.

    void eval_app(obj_t inst)
    {
        CONT = make_instruction(finish_apply, VALUES, CONT);
	/* go on to evaluate the first arg which pushes onto VALUES. */
    }

    void finish_apply(obj_t inst)
    {
        obj_t proc = VALUES.pop();
        ENV.push(make_env(proc.arglist, VALUES, inst.arg));
	proc = VALUES.pop();
    }

This doesn't work.  Need to check, after proc has been evaluated, whether
its args should be evaluated.

----------------------------------
2010.01.30

Need a new layer between except and eval.  Something to handle
all the various reasons to call longjmp().  Call it low-level
exceptions.  lowex.h.

Considering yesterday's idea.  Wondering whether "instruction" is the
right term.  Might also be appropriate to call it a "continuation".

Need to implement a handful of primitives before I can eval a
procedure call.  Peter Michaux started with quote, but I want a
procedure, not a syntax keyword.

Let's suppose we declare primitive procedures like this.

    DEFINE_PROC(L"+", 0-)(obj_t arglist)
    {
        word_t sum = 0;
        while (arglist != EMPTY_LIST) {
            sum += fixnum_value(CAR(arglist));
            arglist = CDR(arglist);
        }
	return make_fixnum(sum);
    }

    DEFINE_PROC(L"cons", 2)(obj_t car, obj_t cdr)
    {
        return CONS(car, cdr);
    }

Just like the old codebase, there will be three kinds of procs,
varying in their scope.  The default scope will be anonymous.

    #define DEFINE_PROC DEFINE_ANONYMOUS_PROC

    #define DEFINE_ANONYMOUS_PROC(scheme_name, arg_range) ...
    #define DEFINE_STATIC_PROC(C_name, scheme_name, arg_range) ...
    #define DEFINE_EXTERN_PROC(C_name, scheme_name, arg_range) ...
