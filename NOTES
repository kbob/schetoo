These notes were, for the most part, written before the corresponding
features were implemented.  So they're likely to be speculative and
inaccurate.

It's interesting (to me) to see the ideas become more refined.



----------------------------------

Note 1: Give up on saving a word on pairs.  Just give them a normal
type record.  Revisit later if you really want to.

Note 2: Unify the rdt and the mem_ops_t.  Give them the same layout,
maybe with some fields unused.  Then the heap copying code doesn't
have to special case record instances.  Add an "I am not in the heap"
flag somewhere, so the copier can ignore out-of-heap rdts.

If we're going to use the C reader with Scheme I/O, we need a general
way for C to call Scheme.  I think.

Time to refactor mem.h.  First cut: three kinds of data -- whole heap
operations, things that are needed for obj definitions, and things
that are needed throughout the interpreter.

Whole heap stuff (heap.h?)
	set_heap_size_bytes()
	init_heap()
	
Obj definition stuff (mem.h?):
	heap_object_t
	OBJ_ALIGN
	is_forward()
	is_immediate()
	is_special()
	obj_heap_ptr()
	obj_fwd_ptr()
	heap_object_set_fwd_ptr()
	mem ops
	mem_ops_t definition
	heap_object
	obj_heap_object()
	heap_obect_mem_ops()
	obj_mem_ops()
	is_primitive_obj()
	is_record_instance()
	CHECK_OBJ, check_obj
	mem_alloc_obj

Global stuff (obj.h? object.h?):
	obj_t
	word_t
	masks, tags, shifts, and bits
	obj_bits()
	macros to create chars, bools, and reader constants
	FALSE_OBJ (obj_boolean.h?)
	TRUE_OBJ (obj_boolean.h?)
	EMPTY_LIST (obj_null.h?)
	UNDEFINED (obj_undefined.h?)
	END_OF_FILE (obj_???)
	MEM_OPS_PRIMITIVE
	READER_CONSTANT - rename to READER_ACTION?
	is_heap()
	is_null() (obj_null.h?)
	is_undefined (obj_undefined.h)
	mem_ops_t declaration
	obj_type_name()

Work interferes.

Trying to decide what the next big step should be.  I wanted to
implement continuations as records, which means I need records next.
Or I could just do continuations ad-hoc and move on to eval.

I've been thinking about the problem of calling Scheme from C.  I
can't just call eval() from arbitrary places because (a) eval() uses a
static jmp_buf to recover from exceptions, and (b) I'm trying to have
a hard bound on C stack size.

So I reviewed the C coroutine literature.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine#Implementations_for_C
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/coroutines.html

Nothing there appears to be directly applicable.  So for now, the rule
is, C does not call Scheme (except once at the top level).

So let's talk about eval.  One question to answer is, what happens
when a procedure is applied to some arguments?  The old Scheme
interpreter had some complex mumbo-jumbo where it built the arg list
in place as each arg was evaluated, and then the procedure was called.

I'm envisioning four registers.

    CONT is the continuation register.  It points to the current
    eval's continuation.  Think of it as a return PC.

    TBE is to-be-evaluated.  It points to a LIFO list of expressions
    to evaluate.

    VALUES points to a LIFO list of values of past evaluations.

    ENV is the current environment.

Eval's basic operation is to pop one item off TBE, evaluate it,
push the result onto VALUES, and then jump to CONT.

For self-evaluating expressions, that's pretty easy.

    def eval(expr):
        expr = TBE.pop()
        if expr.is_self_evaluating():
            VALUES = cons(expr, VALUES)
        elif ...
            ...
        goto CONT

For symbols, it's just a lookup in the current environment.

        ...
        elif expr.is_symbol():
            VALUES = cons(ENV.lookup(expr), VALUES)
        ...

For applications (aka procedure calls), we need to push a continuation
to apply the operator to its args and then push more continuations to
evaluate each of the arguments.  (Ignore special forms for now.)

        ...
        elif expr.is_application():
            CONT = make_continuation(code=apply,
                                     arg=expr,
                                     arg2=VALUES,
                                     env=ENV,
                                     cont=CONT)
            for arg in expr.arguments():
                CONT = make_continuation(code=eval,
                                         arg=arg,
                                         env=ENV,
                                         cont=CONT)
        ...

Then apply looks something like this.

    def apply(expr, eoargs):
        # Reverse and null-terminate the argument list
        args = nil
        while VALUES != eoargs:
            args = cons(car(VALUES), args)
            VALUES = cdr(VALUES)
        CONT = make_continuation(code=expr.operator(),
                                 env=push_env(expr.arglist, args, ENV),
                                 cont=CONT)

Something like that.

Meanwhile, there is a large number of primitives.  It would be grand
if we had a simple ABI for simple primitives.  Something like this.

    obj_t my_primitive(obj_t arg1, obj_t arg2)
    {
         return <return value>;
    }

Maybe wrap a macro around that to bind a symbol to the procedure.

    DEFINE_SIMPLE_PROC("my-primitive", 2)(obj_t arg1, obj_t arg2)
    {
        return <return value>;
    }

----------------------------------

Alternative eval VM.

An "instruction" has a varying number of fields (operands).  Two
fields are always included: proc is the C procedure that implements
the instruction, and cont is the address of the next instruction
(continuation).

An instruction manipulates the three global registers, VALUES, ENV,
and CONT.  VALUES is a list of values of previously evaluated
expressions.  ENV is the current environment.  CONT points to the
next instruction.

A self-eval instruction evaluates a self-evaluating expression.  It
has three fields. proc = eval_const, expr = the self-evaluated
expresion, and cont = whatever.  The self_eval procedure looks like
this.

    void eval_const(obj_t inst)
    {
        VALUES.push(inst.arg);
	CONT = CONT.cont
    }

Each instruction the result of evaluating its expression.

A eval_symbol instruction evaluates a symbol.  It uses the global
register ENV.  The three fields are proc = eval_sym, arg = the symbol,
and cont.

    void eval_sym(obj_t inst)
    {
        VALUES.push(lookup(inst.arg, ENV);)
    }

An application instruction applies a procedure to a symbol.  It has
three fields: proc = eval_app, arg = VALUES, and cont = whatever.
eval_app looks like this.

    void eval_app(obj_t inst)
    {
        CONT = make_instruction(finish_apply, VALUES, CONT);
	/* go on to evaluate the first arg which pushes onto VALUES. */
    }

    void finish_apply(obj_t inst)
    {
        obj_t proc = VALUES.pop();
        ENV.push(make_env(proc.arglist, VALUES, inst.arg));
	proc = VALUES.pop();
    }

This doesn't work.  Need to check, after proc has been evaluated, whether
its args should be evaluated.

----------------------------------
2010.01.30

Need a new layer between except and eval.  Something to handle
all the various reasons to call longjmp().  Call it low-level
exceptions.  lowex.h.

Considering yesterday's idea.  Wondering whether "instruction" is the
right term.  Might also be appropriate to call it a "continuation".

Need to implement a handful of primitives before I can eval a
procedure call.  Peter Michaux started with quote, but I want a
procedure, not a syntax keyword.

Let's suppose we declare primitive procedures like this.

    DEFINE_PROC(L"+", 0-)(obj_t arglist)
    {
        word_t sum = 0;
        while (arglist != EMPTY_LIST) {
            sum += fixnum_value(CAR(arglist));
            arglist = CDR(arglist);
        }
	return make_fixnum(sum);
    }

    DEFINE_PROC(L"cons", 2)(obj_t car, obj_t cdr)
    {
        return CONS(car, cdr);
    }

Just like the old codebase, there will be three kinds of procs,
varying in their scope.  The default scope will be anonymous.

    #define DEFINE_PROC DEFINE_ANONYMOUS_PROC

    #define DEFINE_ANONYMOUS_PROC(scheme_name, arg_range) ...
    #define DEFINE_STATIC_PROC(C_name, scheme_name, arg_range) ...
    #define DEFINE_EXTERN_PROC(C_name, scheme_name, arg_range) ...

----------------------------------
2010.02.02 (Groundhog Day)

What shall the calling convention for C special forms be?
Keep in mind that call/cc is a procedure, not a special form.

Examples:
	define
	define-syntax
	quote
	lambda
	if
	set!
	let (and friends)
	begin

obj_t my_special_form(obj_t cont, obj_t form)
{
    return a_continuation;
}

So what about call/cc?  It needs to be marked special somehow
so that it can access its continuation.  apply probably needs
the same treatment.

So I think instead of the current two procedure flags,

    PF_COMPILED_C
    PF_SPECIAL_FORM

there should be three flags:

    PF_COMPILED_C
    PF_RAW
    PF_ARGS_UNEVALUATED

RAW means that the procedure can be called directly from the
eval trampoline.  (Maybe there's a better name.)

ARGS_UNEVALUATED means what it says.

What special forms wouldn't need the PF_RAW flag?
Not define, if, or set!.  They each need to push a continuation.
Not begin.  It needs to manipulate the continuation stack.
Not lambda.  It needs a pointer to the current environment.
Not let.  It needs to manipulate the environment.

How about quote?  Sure, quote doesn't need PF_RAW.

    DEFINE_COOKED_SPECIAL_FORM(L"quote", 1)(obj_t datum)
    {
        return datum;
    }

Otherwise, it would be something like this.

    DEFINE_SPECIAL_FORM(L"quote")(obj_t cont, obj_t *p_values, obj_t *p_env)
    {
        *p_values = CONS(cont3_arg1(cont), *p_values);
        return cont_cont(cont);
    }

What are the macros?

DEFINE_RAW_PROC(name, arg_range).  (Still not happy with the name.)
DEFINE_SPECIAL_FORM() (implies RAW + ARGS_UNEVALUATED).
Anonymous, static and extern variants.

Cons cell optimization idea number 188^W33.

A heap object has three possible value for its first word.
If it's forwarded, it has a forwarding pointer, tag 0x02.
If it's a non-cons, non-forwarded object, it has a mem_ops_t
pointer, tag 0x00.  If it's a non-forwarded cons cell, then
either the first word (car) is a fixnum/immediate or it has
a tag of 0x04.

bool is_pair(obj_t p)
{
    if (!is_heap_obj(p))
        return false;
    word_t tag = *(word_t *)p & LONG_TAG_MASK;
    return tag != HEAP_TAG;		/* ignore forwarding pointers */
}

mem_ops_t *obj_mem_ops(obj_t p)
{
    if (is_pair(p))
        return &pair_ops;
    else
        return heap_object_mem_ops(obj_heap_object(obj));
}

is_pair() is basically the same cost as it is now.  In the current
scheme, we do a memory access to load the mem_ops_t pointer.  In the
new scheme, we'll do a memory access to load the car.

obj_mem_ops() has an extra test and branch.

In exchange, pairs save 8 bytes on 32 and 64 bit architectures.
On 32 bit, we go from 4 to 8 cons cells per cache line.
On 64 bit, we go from 2.67 to 4.

So I think it's a win.

Now, what about a mutability flag?  

Some objects are inherently immutable: all the immediate objects,
continuations, rtds, symbols, and procedures.

The potentially mutable objects are pair, string, vector, bytevector,
binding, and record instance.

Binding is easy.  It already has a mutability flag.
String - could jam a flag bit into the size field.  Since elements are
	multibyte, don't need all 32 or 64 bits for size.
Vector, bytevector - ditto.
Record instance - handled at a higher level - can't construct
       a mutator for an immutable field.
Pair - ???

The only thing that comes to mind is to downgrade fixnums to 30 bits
so there are more bits to play with.

----------------------------------

Records.

I started implementing records tonight.  Got part way through
and found out I'm doing it wrong.

1. All rtd's must be stored in the heap.  I was thinking that there
   would be some in heap and some in C .data section.  But the
   contents of an rtd has to be GC'd, so it's easier to put it in the
   heap than declare each field a root.

   1a. Record instances don't need to check for a primitive
       rtd.  That makes instance mem_ops simpler.

2. r6rs-lib requires a specific format for the `field' argument
   when it's passed (by reference) to make-record-type-descriptor.
   So that's the format I'll use.

3. An instance should be laid out like a vector, except it doesn't
   need a length field if the rtd has a length field.

   3a. The rtd should have a number-of-fields field.

4. Accessors need to index into the fields.  Sort of like
   (lambda (rec) (vector-get rec 3))

   4a.  Should record_get_by_index()/record_set_by_index() functions.

   4b.  Accessors will be created by Scheme.  C will export lower-
        level procedures, maybe just accessors for parent and fields.

5. Field storage for a record instance should be in-line in the record.

It seems like it should be almost straightforward -- bad magic is
happening in the overloading, in a record instance, of
(heap_object).ho_ops and the rtd pointer and in the overloading, in an
rtd, of (rtd_obj_t).rtd_inst_ops.mo_start_marker and
(heap_object.ho_ops, but that was accounted for long ago when I
defined the basic heap object layout.

So what, exactly, is &syntax?  I think syntax is a root pointer to the
syntax rtd.  Or maybe it's a structure containing the root pointer so
there's a little C type safety.

And I'll need a DECLARE_RTD(name, ...) analogous to DECLARE_PROC()
which squirrels stuff away until the heap is initialized, then
creates the RTD and stores a pointer in a named C variable.

Think about auxilliary syntax.

Symbols with special meanings like else, =>, ..., mutable.  Bind them
to a magic inevaluable type but with distinct values.  Think about
what makes free-identifier=? evaluate true.

I claimed that I could pass NULL to raise with impunity.
Well, now it's time to figure out who &who is.
Back in the top-level, there's a continuation pointer.

    code = cont_code(cont)
    if (code == c_apply_proc)
	operator = CAR(cont4_arg(cont));
    else if (code == c_eval_operator)
	operator = CAR(values);
    else
	operator = eval;  //why not?

But that's all at top-level.  I guess I should pack up the other stuff
and build &who and the compound condition back up there.

---

RAISE() builds a compound condition.  Hands it off.  Now I need
to store it in a static variable in eval, decode the &who (later),
and pass it to a pretty print routine.  All the info is there,
but it's scattered around.  Probably need some more condition
accessors too.

How about this for a target message format?

Source file and line number would be nice, but...

Time to 'blog.

First, introduce the new Scheme.  List its major features.
(Lots of datatypes, lots of primitives, some cool stuff
like call/cc and exceptions.

Second, talk about the eval environment.
1. Bounded stack use (with exceptions).
1. It uses trampolines.
2. Pseudo-VM.  cont, values, and dynamic environment.

Third, talk about the setjmp/longjmp hack.

Son of Scheme: Introducing Schetoo

I've started a new Scheme project.  This one is called Schetoo.  The
name has connotations of "Scheme Two", "me too", and "Gentoo" (a
hardcore Linux distribution and a breed of penguin).

A 'blogger named Peter Michaux started a series in January called <a
href="http://peter.michaux.ca/index#Scheme%20from%20Scratch">Scheme
from Scratch</a>.  His goal was to write a very quick and dirty
Scheme, just enough to bootstrap a Scheme compiler.  I read his
postings and decided to get started again.

Schetoo is similar in concept to my first Scheme, <a href="http://kernelbob.wordpress.com/tag/kbscheme/">kbscheme</a>.  In fact,
I reused a fair amount of code to get Schetoo up and running faster.
But at the same time, I'm applying what I learned to try to get a
better design.

I've published the code on GitHub.
<a href="http://github.com/kbob/schetoo">http://github.com/kbob/schetoo</a>

Goals

The primary goal for Schetoo is pedagogical.  I want to understand the
Scheme language and how to design language runtimes.  I intend to
focus on performance more than last time, because kbscheme was running
for many seconds just initializing itself.

Another goal is to have no dynamic memory outside of the heap.  No
recursion so stack size is bounded.  No mallocs.  At present, it falls
short of that in two ways.  My I/O subsystem uses malloc for memory
buffers, and the print routine is recursive.  Both were thrown
together early on to get something running, and both will eventually
be rewritten.  I'll rewrite I/O in C and rewrite print in Scheme so it
can remain recursive.

The third goal is to integrate macro translation into Schetoo.
I'm not sure how that will work.

Status

Right now, Schetoo is usable for toy programs.

It has a heap with lots of primitive data types: bindings,
bytevectors, Booleans, Unicode characters, continuations, fixnums,
pairs, procedures, records, record type descriptors (RTDs), strings,
symbols, and vectors.  The interpreter also has a hierarchy of
condition types constructed from records.  (A Scheme condition is like
a Python exception object.)

It has an assortment of primitives for operating on and converting
among those types.  I count 44 primitives at the moment.

The reader came from kbscheme, and just like kbscheme, it handles the
whole R6RS Scheme language except for non-fixnum numbers.

It also has an evaluator with a nice extension mechanism for adding
more procedures and special forms.  Some of the more interesting forms
I've implemented are apply, call/cc, define, eval, if, lambda, quote
and set!.

There is an exception mechanism, and all the forms are wired to
generate exceptions as needed.  There is no way to set an exception
handler yet -- the default handler just prints the message and pops
back to the REPL.

Finally, there's a clever mechanism to track stack-based heap roots
with zero overhead.  That will be the subject of a future post.

I'm planning to implement dynamic-wind and multiple-value expressions
someday.  The evaluator was designed with them in mind, but they're
not implemented yet.

Design

Once again, the implementation language is C.  The overall structure
is a trampoline-style interpreter using explicit continuations instead
of a call stack.  This time, I'm planning to write less C and more
Scheme.  I'm almost at the point where the read-eval-print loop (REPL)
can be written in Scheme.

I used the same basic heap and garbage collector design as last time.
There are two significant differences, though.

First, small objects are stored as immediate pointers.  Those include
fixnums, (Unicode) characters, Booleans, the empty list, and some
other constants.  For example, the Boolean false is represented as a
pointer with the binary value 0x0000000E.  There's nothing stored at
address 0x0000000E, it's just a bit pattern.

Second, I've implemented records.  Records are Scheme's objects.  Each
record has a class (called a record type descriptor or RTD), and
classes have single inheritance.  Those both went into the heap design
fairly easily.

The evaluator is also similar at a high level, but completely
different in the details.  There is a virtual machine (VM), and the VM
is a little better defined than last time.  I think I'll write a
future post about the VM design, too.

And exceptions got designed in early.  That's an important part of
building a usable interactive environment.

Next Steps

I'd like to get the REPL into Scheme.  To do that, I need user
exception handlers and I/O primitives.

Scan and read need to be rewritten to be leaf routines.  That will be
challenging.  Right now, I'm severely limited

----------------------------------
2010.03.05

I have to turn the parser and scanner inside-out.

Let's assume that I have an I/O library with the equivalent of
getchar() and peekchar(), aka ungetc(getchar(), stdin).

read_datum() should repeatedly call peekchar(), and pass each
character to the scanner's scan_char().  If that succeeds, then the
scanner returns zero, one or two tokens which should be passed on to
the parser.  If the parser succeeds, then the scanner can update its
state, and the io stream can commit to reading the character.

We could fail in peekchar(), which is not a problem, since peekchar()
is the first thing to run.  getchar() after peekchar() must never
fail.  (Should be easy enough -- getchar() just updates the file or
buffer position.)

We could fail in scan_char() when it tries to allocate a token.
If that happens, we want to retry peekchar() and we want to leave
the scanner's state unchanged.

After the scanner has returned zero, one or two tokens, we want to
commit that.  Save the tokens, if any, and call getchar().  Can the
tokens be stored in a continuation?  Yes, that's the best place.

"Calling" getchar() means pushing a continuation pointing to it
then returning into that continuation.

Then call the parser to update its state based on the new tokens.
(If no tokens, continue directly to another call to peekchar()
and scan_char().)  If we fail in the parser, we'll retry the
parse step.

So I see four entry points.

   getchar()
   peekchar()
   scan_char()
   parse_token()

(R6RS uses the names peek-char and read-char.)

1. read-char can be a simple procedure.  It takes 0-1 args.
It returns a character.

2. peek-char ditto.  It can also fail, returning EOF.

Later, read-char and peek-char can be written in Scheme and use
get-u8 and eof-object as the primitives.  But for now, I'll implement
read-char and peek-char in C.

3. scan_char() is a raw procedure.  Its arguments, which it must
unpack itself, are a character and its starting state.  It pushes
continuations onto the stack and returns.  If it recognizes zero
tokens, here's the continuation stack it makes.

    get-char -> discard-value -> peek-char -> scan_char -> [current TOS]

If there's one token, it looks like this.

    get-char -> discard-value -> parse_token -> peek-char -> scan-char -> [TOS]

If scan_char() sees EOF, it doesn't push itelf.  It just pushes
any parse_token calls and returns.

I'm thinking we need a primitive "get-char and discard value".
Or maybe I can set up the registers just so.

For now, the first thing to do is implement peek-char and get-char.
And their friends, current-input-port and open-input-file.

----------------------------------
2010.03.06

Okay, I wrote a minimal I/O library.  Four procedures: read-char,
peek-char, eof-object, and eof-object?.

----------------------------------
2010.03.07

When EOF is reached, scan_char should exit the loop.
The continuation stack should look like this.

    parse_token -> [TOS]

Expand the earlier stack a bit (zero tokens case).

    get-char -> discard-value -> peek-char -> scan-char -> [TOS]

expands to
    get-char      w/ values = ()
    discard-value w/ values = (char)
    peek-char     w/ values = ()
    scan-char     w/ values = reverse(char scan-ctx)
    TOS		  w/ values = whatever

saved values are stored in CDR(cont4_arg(cont)).

----------------------------------
2010.03.08

It's time to make some changes to continuations before I delve into
the messy project of building them into the new reader.

Goals.

  - (G.ENV) Remove env from continuation, keep as separate register,
    saved and restored as needed.

  - (G.SEP) Separate c_apply_proc's proc and saved_values parameters.

  - (G.ORD) Rearrange make_cont's arguments like this.
    [opcode, arg ..., env(?), next].

  - (G.VFY) Add an assertion to every cont proc that it is called
    with the right continuation type.

I'm not sure that G.ENV will actually be faster, though.  The cv_t
will become a triple, cve_t, and each cont proc will be called with
three args instead of two.  If we didn't have the trampoline, it
would definitely be faster.

Maybe I should write a benchmark comparing the current thing
vs. cve_t vs. keeping env in a global root.

---

Benchmark results are in.  V3 is fastest.  (with my compiler on my
PC today)

    ~/scheme2> time ./a.out
    version 1 result 1000000000 time 10.4975
    version 2 result 1000000000 time 10.3443
    version 3 result 1000000000 time 9.79096
    30.629u 0.000s 0:30.63 99.9%    0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w

Version 1 is what we have today.  Each cont_proc takes two arguments,
cont and values.  It returns a cv_t structure which contains cont
and values.  Env is in the continuation structure, and is copied
by every op.

Version 2 is the cve_t idea.  Each cont_proc takes three arguments,
cont, values, and env.  It returns a cve_t structure which contains
cont, values, and env.

Version 3 keeps env in a global variable.  Every tenth operation
updates env.

The source code is in regbench.c.
