I've been working on a Scheme interpreter.  It has progressed to the
point where its core works and the basic design has been shown to be
viable.  It's by no means finished &mdash; can a project like this ever
be finished?

But it's at a coherent point, so it seems like a good time to pause
and discuss.  This is the first in a planned series of articles
that will give a grand tour Schetoo's design.  

I'm planning to write about the memory manager/garbage collector,
about the execution model and continuation passing, about exceptions,
and finally about Schetoo's transactions, which are so weird I can't
even define them here.

But first, the memory manager.

---

Schetoo's memory manager undersits everything else.  The memory
manager provides a safe interface to <dfn>typed memory</dfn>.
User-defined types can be defined and instantiated at compile or run
time.  The memory manager automatically deallocates memory objects
that are no longer in use.

By <dfn>typed memory</dfn>, I mean that instead of an undifferentiated
array of bytes, the memory manager exports references to objects of
various types, such as pair, vector, symbol, and character.  Some of
the types allow access to their contents as arrays of bytes &mdash; in
fact, that's exactly what the bytevector type does.  But in general,
objects are opaque.  They have to be accessed through their API.

By <dfn>safe interface</dfn>, I mean that the so long as the memory
manager's clients don't step outside the API, the heap will retain its
integrity.

For example, let's look at the pair type.  A Scheme pair is an object
that holds two other objects, called the car and cdr.

Here's the public interface.

<pre>
    extern obj_t        make_pair      (obj_t car, obj_t cdr);

    static inline bool  is_pair        (obj_t);
    static inline obj_t pair_car       (obj_t);
    static inline obj_t pair_cdr       (obj_t);
    extern void         pair_set_car   (obj_t pair, obj_t car);
    extern void         pair_set_car_nc(obj_t pair, obj_t car);
    extern void         pair_set_cdr   (obj_t pair, obj_t cdr);
    extern void         pair_set_cdr_nc(obj_t pair, obj_t cdr);
</pre>

The constructor is make_pair().  All object constructors have names
starting with make_.  Pairs just have one constructor, but some types
have several.  make_pair() returns a <dfn>fresh</dfn> pair
initialized with the given car and cdr.

There is one type predicate, is_pair().  is_pair accepts any object
and returns true if that object is a pair.

There are two accessors, pair_car() and pair_cdr().  They will raise
an exception if they're called on a non-pair object.

There are two mutators, pair_set_car() and pair_set_cdr().  They also
raise an exception if their first argument is not a pair.

Finally, there are the _nc mutators.  nc stands for "no check".  Those
are called internally by the interpreter when it is illegal to raise
an exception.  The caller guarantees that the first argument is a
pair, and the mutator checks anyway and aborts the world if it isn't.

Wait, what?  "When it's illegal to raise an exception???"  I'll
explain in a future article.

What's missing from this interface?  Any knowledge of how the pair is
laid out in memory.  That's the heap's business, not its clients'.

What else is missing?  There's no destructor.  We don't need one,
because the memory manager automatically deallocates unused objects.
It does that through garbage collection (GC).

When talking about garbage collection, it's common to think of the
program as two actors.  The <dfn>collector</dfn> collects the garbage.
The <dfn>mutator</dfn> manipulates the heap by creating, dereferencing,
mutating, and forgeting objects.  In other words, the mutator is the
rest of the system.

The other useful term is <dfn>root</dfn>.  A root is an object
reference, outside the heap, that points into the heap.  The collector
preserves all objects reachable from a root, and collects all that
aren't.  The mutator, at least while the collector is active, can't
have any object references anywhere except in a root &mdash; otherwise the
collector might collect them while they're being used.

Collector, mutator, and root are general terms for managed memory
systems.  But back to Schetoo.

Any constructor may, instead of creating an object, raise the
HEAP_FULL exception.  When that happens, the mutator has to call
collect_garbage() before constructing any more objects.  When
collect_garbage() is called, all object references become invalid,
except those stored in roots.

These macros declare variables as roots.  Roots must be statically
allocated.

    ROOT(name1)	            // a root, initialized to undefined.

    ROOT_CONSTRUCTOR(name2) // a root initialized to some value.
    {
	return [some value];
    }

That's about it.  Typed objects with procedural interfaces,
automatically reclaimed, and a bunch of root objects.

In the next article, I'll explain how the memory manager implements
all this.

----------------------------------

This is the Nth article in the Schetoo tour.  Last time, I looked at
the abstraction the memory manager provides.  Now it's time to see how
that abstraction is implemented.

Schetoo's memory manager is type-extensible.  Each type defines the
memory layout of its objects, with a one-word common header.  New
types can be defined either in C or in Scheme without modifying the
memory manager core.  Small objects are stored as immediate values in
their references.  The garbage collector uses a stop-and-copy algorithm.

There are two kinds of objects: immediate objects and heap objects.
Immediate objects are small and immutable.  They are stored directly
in the object reference.  Heap objects are stored in the heap.

Heap objects are always stored at addresses that are multiples of
eight.  That means the lowest three bits are always zero.  Immediate
objects use the low three bits as a <dfn>tag</dfn> to identify the
object type.

Fixnums are small integers.  On a 32 bit architecture, they can range
from -(2**30) to +(2**30 - 1), or -1,073,741,824 to +1,073,741,823.  A
small integer is stored in its reference left-shifted by one bit, with a
tag of 1 in the low-order bit.

    typedef struct object *obj_t;

    obj_t make_fixnum(int n)
    {
	return (obj_t)((n &lt;&lt; 1) | 1);
    }

On a 64-bit architecture, a fixnum has 63 bits.

That accounts for five of the eight tags.  000 is a heap object.  001,
011, 101, and 111 are fixnums.  The remaining three tags are 010, 100
and 110.  010 is used for a forward pointer, described below.  100 is
reserved for future use.  And 110 is for all other immediate objects.

An immediate object (other than a fixnum) has an eight bit tag.  The
low three bits are 110, and the high five bits distinguish various
types of immediate objects.  That leaves space for 32 types of
immediates.  Currently, only four are defined.


   00000 110 - character (Unicode code point)
   00001 110 - Boolean
   00010 110 - Read action
   00011 110 - Special

The rest of the word is used to distinguish immediate objects of
that type.  So on a 32-bit architecture, there are 24 bits for
each type.  There are 1.1 million Unicode code points, two
Booleans, seven read actions, and currently six special values.

Let's look at the special values.

EMPTY_LIST, aka nil or null, is well-known in Scheme.

UNDEFINED_OBJ is the result of any operation whose value is not
specified.

END_OF_FILE is returned by read procedures and by
<code>eof-object</code>.

MISSING_ARG is used internally by the interpreter.  It is passed to a
primitive with optional arguments when those arguments are not
supplied.

MEM_OPS_PRIMITIVE is used by the memory manager.  It's described
below.

END_OF_ARGS is used by variadic C macros to mark the end of the
argument list.

The first three are sometimes visible to Scheme programs; the last
three are not.

That accounts for the immediate objects.  There are a lot of them, and
they have a lot of different formats.  But that does not slow the
interpreter down.  In every case, the interpreter needs to test for one
or two types, and can ignore the rest.

So let's go on to heap objects.  There are two kinds: primitive
objects and user-defined objects or records.  Both kinds start
with a pointer to a mem_ops_t structure which holds type-related
information.  The rest of the object's memory is type-specific.

There are three abstract types that primitive types can derive from.
A mem_scalar is an object that has no object references.  For example,
strings and bytevectors are scalars.  A fixvec is a fixed-size vector
of object references.  For example, a pair is a fixvec of length 2.
And a mixvec is a vector of a fixed number of references and and a
fixed number of scalar words.  An I/O port is a mixvec of 5 scalars
and 6 object references.

A primitive object doesn't have to derive from any of those abstract
types &mdash; they're just there for convenience.

I mentioned a mem_ops_t structure.  Here is the definition.

<pre>
typedef struct mem_ops mem_ops_t;

struct mem_ops {
    obj_t                 mo_start_marker;
    const wchar_t        *mo_name;	/* object class's name */
    mem_ops_t            *mo_super;	/* superclass pointer */
    mem_size_op          *mo_size;
    mem_ptr_count_op     *mo_ptr_count;
    mem_move_op          *mo_move;
    mem_get_ptr_op       *mo_get_ptr;
    mem_set_ptr_op       *mo_set_ptr;
    mem_end_marker_t      mo_end_marker;
};
</pre>

The various op members are functions that operate on the object.
For example, here's the mem_move_op prototype.

<pre>
/* move the object to the new location. */
typedef void mem_move_op(const heap_object_t *src, heap_object_t *dst);
</pre>

The only thing the memory manager knows about the object's memory
layout is that the first word points to the mem_ops.  It manipulates
the object through its mem_ops.  Clients of the object only manipulate
it through its constructors, accessors, and mutators.  So the object's
layout is thoroughly encapsulated.

<dfn>Records</dfn> are 








Memory is allocated in units of words.  A word is big enough to hold a
pointer.  Fortunately, C has a type for that.

    #include <stdint.h>
    typedef intptr_t word_t;
    typedef uintptr_t uword_t;



An object is a pointer.  Scheme is dynamically typed, so there's not a
lot of static typing going on.  Everything is an object, and every
object is a

Some objects are stored in memory.  (We'll get to the ones that aren't
later.)  Those are called heap objects, and they each start with a
one-word header.

    typedef struct heap_object {
	mem_ops_t *ho_ops;
    } heap_object_t;

You can think of the header as a class pointer.  It points to a
mem_ops_t structure which contains a class name, a superclass pointer,
and some virtual function pointers.  The virtual functions will come
into play during garbage collection.

    typedef struct mem_ops {
	obj_t                 mo_start_marker;
	const wchar_t        *mo_name;	/* object class's name */
	mem_ops_t            *mo_super;	/* superclass pointer */
	mem_size_op          *mo_size;
	mem_ptr_count_op     *mo_ptr_count;
	mem_move_op          *mo_move;
	mem_get_ptr_op       *mo_get_ptr;
	mem_set_ptr_op       *mo_set_ptr;
	mem_end_marker_t      mo_end_marker;
    } mem_ops_t;
